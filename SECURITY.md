# Security Policy

## 📢 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **Nextjango**, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, email us directly at **security@sylken.io** with the details. We take all reports seriously and will respond as quickly as possible.

You may also use GitHub’s [private vulnerability reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) if available.

## 🛠 What We'll Do

- Acknowledge receipt of the report within 24–48 hours
- Review and validate the issue
- Patch the vulnerability in a timely manner
- Credit you (if desired) once disclosed

---

## 🔐 Supported Versions

We currently support only the **latest version** of Nextjango.  
Security fixes will not be backported unless the issue is severe.

## ❤️ Thank You

Responsible disclosure keeps open source safe.  
Thanks for helping make Nextjango more secure!
